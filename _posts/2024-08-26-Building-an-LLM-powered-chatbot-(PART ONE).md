I am learning to build a smart conversational chatbot with AI capabilities, like chatgpt and the like, after couple munites of research, I found out all the components I would be using to build my chatbot and how all the pieces work together, which also shows how most conversational bots and GPT clones are built and how they work under the hood.

Let's go through how these chatbots are built which are a number of components being engineered together to give me my smart chatbot

### Components of Our Chatbot
1. Large Language Model (LLM)
    - Model: A powerful pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA, etc from the hugging Face `transformaers` library)
    - Tokenizer: The LLM's tokenizer is responsible for breaking down input text into tokens that the model can process.

2. Prompt Engineering
    - Input Handling: Crafting prompts that help the model understan the context and generate relevant responses.
    - Formating: Ensure that prompts are formatted correctly to maintain coherance in conversations.

3. Retreival System (for RAG)
    - Knowledge Base: A Collection of documents, web pages, or knowledge snippets that the chatbot can access for enhanced responses.
    - Embeddings: Represents the documents and user queries as high-dimensional vectors using pre-trained embedding models.
    - Similarity Search: Uses a similarity search tool like `faiss` or cloud services like `pinecone` to match user queries with the most relevant docuent from the knowledge base.

4. Rest-api
    - External APIs: Information needed by chatbot can be drawn from external APIs, i.e. NewsAPI.

5. Response Generation
    - RAG Model: Integrate document retrieval with LLM response generation
    - LLM Output: Generate a response from the LLM, guided by the relevant content from documents/Knownledge base.

6. Conversation Management
    - Memory and Context Handling: Maintain context across multiple user inputs.
    - Session Management: Ensure that the user sessions are maintained, especially when handling multiple users in real-time.

7. NLP Proprocessing
    - Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatiazation, stopword removal, etc, to clean and structure user input for better processing.
    - Entity Recognition and Intent Detection: Use additional NLP tools to recognize entities (e.g. names, dates) or classify user intent to rout the conversation more effectively.

8. Fine-tuning
    - Custom Training: Finetune the LLM on domain-specific data to improve its performance for particular use cases.
    - Transfer Learning: Adapt pre-trained LLM to your specific domain using additional training data that captures ypur chatbot's intended tone, behaviour and knowledge.

9. User Interface (UI)
    - Web or Mobile Interface: Front-end that allows users to interact with the chatbot.
    - API Integration: An API to interact with the LLM and retrieval system, which allows for communication between the backend and the user interface.

10. Evaluation and Feedback Loop
    - Performance Monitoring
    - Error Handling
    - Continuous Learning

11. Deployment and Scaling
    - Model Hosting: Deploy the LLM and retrieval system on servers or cloud platforms.
    - Scaling Infrastructure: Ensuring your chatbot can scale with increased user demand.


Though one should note that depending on the simplicity or complexity of your chatbot, not all the components may be needed.

In PART 2, I'll go into how these components interact with each other to give us our final product, "A Smart Conversational Chatbot".
