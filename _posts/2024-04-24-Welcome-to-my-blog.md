## Introduction

This blog is dedicated to documenting and sharing my knowledge and learning jorney which centers around **Data-Science, Machine Learning**/**Artificial Intelligence,** **Forex** and **Finance**.

## Self Introduction

Welcome!, my name is Okezie Ben-John, Bsc Accounting (2022) from Mountain-Top University, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. While in school, I developed interest in programming even though I didn't have much background in computer science, but was able to learn just enough to build simple websites and applications.  
Then I didn't really have any clear plan of what I wanted to do with it order than playing around with code. With no clear plan, I jumped from one tech stack to another (javascirpt to C# to python), web dev to game dev to app dev and never really staying consistent or going deep enough to master one and even negleting my studies too, eventually I ended up developing deep interest in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence, cause I had lost interest in my discipline long before then, which obviously affected my grade and ended up with an extra year.  
As time went on, I really hoped I could get into programming as a fulltime job having heard that you could become one without the need of a computer science degree so I kept practicing and searching but still wasn't lucky enough to land a small gig. In hindsight, there are lot of things I could have done better and differently to have increased my chances of getting a job which I do regret but we move.  
Moving forward, I graduate and started my NYSC program, I was fortunante enough to work at DataLead Africa, a firm that specializes in training individuals on data skills i.e, Data Analytics, Data Science and with that was able to sharpen my skills to a point and I'm greatful for that experience.  
Now I'm done with NYSC service, even though I learnt alot from my service year I still feel somewhat inadequate trying to get into a discipline I have no certification in.  
Which is why I decided to start this writing jorney and build an online presence, so at leaest to keep it enjoyable while I'm still learning and improving, with hope that it will all work out someday.
